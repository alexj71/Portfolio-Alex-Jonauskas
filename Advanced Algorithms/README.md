# Advanced Algorithms Projects
## Description
Advanced Algorithms is a PhD level CS course at Ohio University where students learn and apply the code to NP-Complete problems. NP-Complete problems are problems without an efficient solution however in many real world scenarios we can add a restriction or an extra piece of information that allows us to come up with an efficient enough solution. In this folder are my solutions to many of the projects in this course.

## Table of Contents
- Zero Sum:
Zero Sum is a variation of the subset sum problem. In the zero sum folder you will find a more detailed explanation as well as my __C++__ code of a __dynamic programming__ solution to zero sum.

- Domino Tiling:
Domino Tiling is a puzzle similiar to sudoku that we were asked to code a solution to.

- MWVC:
    - Recursive solution to minimum weight vertex cover (MWVC) that runs in o(1.5^n)
    - Bounded search tree algorithm for MWVC where the MWVC can be at most size k

## Results
I recieved an A in Advanced Algorithms and learned a plethora of "out of the box" solutions to complex problems.
