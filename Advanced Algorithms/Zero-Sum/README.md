# Zero Sum Problem: 
Zero sum is a variation of the NP complete problem subset sum. Given a set S of integers and a target k we are tasked with finding if there is a subset of set S that sums to 0 and is size k. If so, then print the subset(s). We can solve this problem in pseudo-polynomial time by using dynamic programming. In rather general terms, pseudo polynomial time means that the runtime is reasonable when the length of the input is small enough. Dynamic Programming is typically the use of a datastructure to store the results of subproblems so that we do not repeat finding the results of those subproblems again (which is typically something that happens when using a recursive solution). In zero sum we apply this by making a boolean array. The number of columns is dependent on the largest and smallest possible sums while the number of rows is dependent on the elements in the set. We itterate through the array filling each cell with either true or false depending on elements in the previous row. The algorithm works in such that if an index is marked true than the number corresponding to that column can be reached via the number corresponding to that row and some previous combination of other numbers. Therefore once the algorithm runs, we know if we can reach 0 if there is a True in the column corresponding to 0.
