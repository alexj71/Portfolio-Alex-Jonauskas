# Table of Contents

- Advanced Algorithms: Contains my projects from taking a PhD level algorithms course at Ohio University. All of the code is in C++ and some highlights include dynamic programming, recursive algorithms with branch/bound methods, and use of datatypes like pairs and sets

- Datamining: Contains my semester long project from taking a data mining course at Ohio University. All of the code is in Python and some highlights include a predictive classification model using a random forest, the use of bootstraps and out of bag data sets, graphs/tables generated from python, and the filtering/aggregating of data with the pandas library

- Linear-Programming: Contains the results from my semester long independent study. All of the models are in Ampl and the project is an attempt to optimize NFL rating by altering some rules to the NFL schedule.

- R Scripts for Data Science: Contains scripts that were homework or a project in a statistical computing course. Everything is in R and includes the use of linear/logistic/multi-linear regressions, monte carlo method/simulations, and the acceptance/rejection method.

Note: There are more specific README descriptions in each folder.
