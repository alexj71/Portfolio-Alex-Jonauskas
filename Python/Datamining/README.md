# Project Title: Datamining
## Description:
Datamining is a masters level computer science course at Ohio University that I took in the Fall of 2022. We were given data in a basic excel doc with patients filling the rows and genetic mutations filling the columns. Patients did not have names but rather labelled with C1, C2, ... or NC1, NC2,... where C1 is the first patient that had cancer and NC1 is the first patient that did not. If there was a 1 in cell E5, that meant the patient in row 5 had the genetic mutation at the top of column E (if 0 then they did not).
This course was a semester long project attempting to make a model for predicting if a future patient has cancer or not based on the genetic mutations that they had. We were not allowed to use any libraries like sklearn and coded decision trees ourselves. Concepts/skills that were applied included:

- pandas library
- descriptive statistics
- visuals such as donut charts, stacked bar graphs
- confusion matrices
- information measures like Phi and Entropy (for future decision tree use)
- decision trees
- decision trees with bootstraps
- decision forrest with bootstraps

## Informal Table of Contents:
In this folder you can find seemingly random snippits of code and results of that code. These were various files that needed to be submitted. The most important files to concern yourself with are "main.py" and "Final Report.docx". The main file has all of the code for every submission, mostly packaged into various functions. The purpose of this structure was so I could quickly reference or use code from a previous assignment if I needed.

## Results:
I recieved an A for my work in this course. My final model to determine if a patient had cancer had similiar accuracy values to my classmates. My professor remark that my code ran fast and I attributed this to taking advanced algorithms the same semester and just trying to keep my code organized as we went from assignment to assignment.
