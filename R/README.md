# Various R Scripts Applicable to various careers I am interested in
## Description:

My last semester a Ohio University I took statistical computing which covered some data science techniques. I have collected and organized the relevant scripts from various assignments/projects here.

## Table of Contents

- Monte carlo scripts:
    - monte carlo estimation of an integral
    - monte carlo simulation of stock to model future price behavior
    - monte carlo method to estimate a confidence interval

- Acceptance/rejection scripts:
    - demonstration of the acceptance/rejection method to simulate cdfs that are not closed-form

- Regression Scripts:
    - Linear Regression
    - Multiple Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression

## Results:
I found using R convient, easy to learn, and enjoyed learning applied statistical techniques.
